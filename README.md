# Poor Mans Workflow based on Quartz Scheduler

## Design-Goals

Build a very basic workflow `engine` which does only really basic stuff and is understood in a second.

- one simple jar to get it running
- no own deployment of a workflow server or any stuff
- reuse of a schedular framework
- be compatible to other frameworks
- Spring integration
